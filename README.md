# CARLA-LIDAR
Cross-sensor validation system detecting LiDAR and camera spoofing attacks in autonomous vehicles. Uses ResNet-50 and Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, with CARLA simulator integration. Demonstrates effective real-time detection and correction of sensor tampering for safer autonomous driving.
